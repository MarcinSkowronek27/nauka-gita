    <h1>Golden Eye</h1>
    <h3>by Tina Turner</h3>
    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <p>See reflections on the water
        More than darkness in the depths
        See him surface in every shadow
        On the wind I feel his breath
        Golden eye I found his weakness
        Golden eye he'll do what I please
        Golden eye no time for sweetness
        But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees</p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p>You'll never know how I watched you
        From the shadows as a child
        You'll never know how it feels to be the one
        Who's left behind
        You'll never know the days, the nights
        The tears, the tears I've cried
        But now my time has come
        And time, time is not on your side</p>
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p>See him move through smoke and mirrors
        Feel his presence in the crowd
        Other girls they gather around him
        If I had him I wouldn't let him out
        Golden eye not lace or leather
        Golden chains take him to the spot
        Golden eye I'll show him forever
        It'll take forever to see
        What I've got</p>
